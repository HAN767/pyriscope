# Pyriscope

A simple Periscope video downloader for Python.

* Easily download any available Periscope stream by simply giving pyriscope the URL.
* Pyriscope automatically downloads and stitches together Periscope chunks.
* Optionally, pyriscope converts the downloaded .ts file to a .mp4 file with optional rotation. (Requires ffmpeg)

Usage:
    `pyriscope <urls> [options]`

See `pyriscope --help` for further details.

$ pip install pyriscope
```

### Usage
